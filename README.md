[OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon is a free, open-source, cross-platform threat modeling application.

The Threat Dragon logo is called Cupcake, and we aim to make threat modeling less threatening.

The [first commit][commit] to the original threat dragon repository was made on 9th October 2015,
so that is Threat Dragon's birthday.
Cupcake has a birthday as well: [DЯΣΛMƧVΣЯƧΣ][dreamsverse] uploaded the original artwork on 7th May 2012.
